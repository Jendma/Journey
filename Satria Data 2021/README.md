# Satria Data 2021

This is my first project for competition in the Data Science field which was held by IPB University through their Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Science, Department of Statistica.
This project is about the age prediction from a lot of images of people provided from the dataset. Here, I used CNN algorithm models for regression.
